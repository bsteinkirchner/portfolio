        Hi! I'm Brittany and I am a counselor turned software developer. I graduated with a Master's Degree of Science in Rehabilitation Counseling in 2020. I worked in rehabilitation for 7 years both during school and post graduation until I
        felt a pull for something more logic and analytics based. I decided to sign up for a coding bootcamp and enjoyed it so much that I left my position to learn to code full time. I completed coursework in HTML5, CSS, responsive design (Bootstrap),
        and Javascript. After this camp ended, I signed up for a Codecademy premium membership and began self-teaching myself different programming languages and frameworks such as Java, React, and SQL. I've completed several different projects that can 
        be found in my portfolio. I continue my education daily with various lessons and modules through Codecademy. I have a passion for front end design and am interested in backend too. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to working as a developer, I am also a mom of 2 little girls. I am excited to show my daughters that women can do anything and can break into male-dominated fields with a little hard work and determination. On the weekends I can be found doing
        puzzles with my oldest, hiking with my family, or attending the local farmer's market with my family. Some fun facts about me include: if I were an animal, I would be a possum and if I were a color, I would be a rainbow. I regularly quote Tiktoks and I
        love listening to live music. I love to plant and spend time outdoors.
        <br>
        <br>
        I believe I have the grit and determination to break into a tech role from a career change. I am quick to learn, motivated, and a self starter. I have learned various coding languages in just over 6 months and I know them well. 
        If you'd like to learn more about me, send me an email, Slack message, or a LinkedIn message. I am excited at the prospect of finding a role to put my skills to work.
